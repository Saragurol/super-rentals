    {{!-- "<LinktTo" component allows us to link pages together --}}

    {{!-- "@route=" is how you pass arguments into the component. Here we use this arguemnt to specify which route we want to link to. Note that this is the name of the route, not the path, which is why i specified "about" instead of "/about" --}}
